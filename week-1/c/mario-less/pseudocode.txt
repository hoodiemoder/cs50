Prompt the user for pyramid layers
Given the input n, print n layers
Each layer adds to a counter i
Layer width is determined by i - n
Stop printing layers when i is equal to n


// Right-Aligning with Dots

Print a square, of height and width $n
while $i > $n - $layer, print "." (dot)
while $i <= $layer, print "#"
when $i = $n print "\n"
