* C


| Input       | Black box | Output       |
| Source code | Compiler  | Machine code |


There are compilers to help us program without needing to write machine code.

Finally translating to binary code.

Writing good code takes time and practice, evaluate the quality:

- Correctness
- Design
  How to communicate, how optimized.
- Style
  Will make it more readable

* Visual Studio
VS Code helps us to format and compile code.

Widely used, various programming languages.

Mix of GUI and CLI

** Editor

** Terminal
CLI, input via keyboard, more features than GUI, efficiency.

Compile code, running.
#+begin_src:
code hello.c
make hello
./hello 
#+end_src:

Follow best practices.
