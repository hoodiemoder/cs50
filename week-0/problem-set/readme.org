** Idea
 Using buttons, you can program a beat.

** Requirements
*** DONE Two sprites (!cat)
Made two sprites for buttons,
button-a and button-b.
*** TODO More than three scripts
*** TODO One Conditional, loop and variable

Need to make a loop that counts the beat

Make the buttons in a grid

Make the button have pressed state

If the buttons are pressed, in the beat, they play their sound

Make the beat repeat forever, make the buttons.


We're making 4 button-a and button-b each.

Position each button to their place, 64x64 grid
starting at -128,64 ending at 64,0
